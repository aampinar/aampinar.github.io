                I have been a huge fan of cooking most of my life and the one recipe that I always enjoy making is a
                good batch of onion rings. One day I was surfing through YouTube and I stumbled across the Epicurious
                channel. If you haven't heard of it, the channel focuses on cooking recipes from all different parts of
                the world. A series the channel recently started was the <em>"Levels of Cooking"</em> series, where an
                amateur, home cook and professional chef would each cook the same food, using their own unique recipes.
                At the end of each recipe, a food scientist would analyze each layer of the recipe and provide feedback
                on ingredient usage, cooking technique and overall recipe rating. The recipe that I found to be one of
                the most interesting was the <em>4 Levels of Onions Rings</em>.<br>
                After watching the video, I combined a few elements of each chef's recipes and found a consistency of
                onion rings that I absolutely enjoy. I won't lie to you and say that after making this recipe, you won't
                become an onion ring snob when you grab a basket from your local sports bar or restaurant. Enjoy!</p>

<h3>Directions For Onion Rings</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Grab a medium frying pan and lightly coat with canola oil. Set temp. to medium.</li>
    <li>Peel Onion and cut into half-inch slices. Don't break them apart yet.</li>
    <li>Season both sides of onion pieces with salt and pepper. Once done, place the onion pieces in pan and cook for 2-3 mins each side, until light browning.</li>
    <li>Once done, place onions on baking sheet and allow onion pieces to cool for 3 mins. Once cool, break apart onion pieces and place them in a large bowl. Pour buttermilk into bowl, making sure onion rings are completely submerged. Place the bowl in the fridge and let chill for 30 mins.</li>
    <li>Grab a medium sized bowl and place flour inside. Remove onion ring bowl from fridge. Grab onion ring, shake off excess buttermilk, coat in flour and then place on a baking sheet. (It's preferred to have a cooling rack with a baking sheet on the bottom. However if you don't have that you can use a baking sheet lined with wax paper)</li>
    <li>Pre-heat frying pan or frying appliance to 400&deg; Fahrenheit.</li>
    <li>
        Grab a large bowl, mix flour, cornmeal, salt, baking powder and paprika until it's all incorporated together.
    </li>
    <li>
        Slowly add beer into large bowl and mix at the same time. Once done, slowly add seltzer water into bowl and mix until smooth light consistency. Once reached, add xanthum gum to bowl and continue to mix until fully incorporated. The batter is now complete.
    </li>
    <li>Now that your setup is complete, It's time to fry the onion rings! My best advice is to have a one hand approach. One wet hand to handle the batter and one dry hand to handle the onion rings with flour. Grab one onion ring and drop it into your batter. Use your other hand to mix the onion ring about the batter, making sure it fully envelops the onion ring.</li>
    <li>Lift the onion ring out of the batter, shake off excess, slowly drop onion ring into fryer or frying pan. Repeat until enough rings are frying to where they barely touch.</li>
    <li>Fry until golden brown. Once achieved, place onion rings back on baking sheet. While the onion rings drain, add salt on top. Allow to cool for 5 minutes and serve.</li>

</ol>

<h3>Directions For Onion Ring Sauce</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Grab a bowl and place 1/2 cup of mayonaise inside for the base.</li>
    <li>Peel yellow onion and cut into half pieces.</li>
    <li>Grab a grater and grate half onion piece with flat side against grater.</li>
    <li>Combine with salt, pepper, sweet relish, adobo sauce, and kethup.</li>
    <li>Mix together until fully incorporated. Enjoy! </li>
